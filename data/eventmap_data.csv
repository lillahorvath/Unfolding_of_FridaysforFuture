Those who are kids now, will be the most affected from the Climate Emergency in the next 20 years. In the next 40 years there may not be an inhabitable planets if we don't act NOW.
The Mumbai Chapter of Fridays For Future (India), with the help of public volunteers as young as 7 years old are going to demonstrate peacefully.
We meet near Hotel Ramada, Juhu at 3.10 pm IST. We plan to meet all safety regulations and permissions by adult volunteers, media and local authorities till 4:30pm. With protection to youngsters and after making arrangements for safe returns of everyone, we gather with our  signboards, placards, cardboards, drawings and writeups, memes, cartoons at Juhu Beach Entrance 1at 5 pm on 24 May 2019. Then we all move upto Birla Lane, while peacefully educating the public and showing our support for the Climate Activist and 2019 Nobel Prize Nominated Greta Thunberg for the causes of climate action, declaring climate emergency, urging those who can act now.
We welcome all.
We will make this fun and enjoyable while we display no anger or resentment.
All the people in power, government,  teachers, students, general public is welcome.
Please read about our cause and if you can bring anything poster that is funny and conveys our message for saving the planet earth from climate energency.
Remember, there's no planet B.
We also welcome everyone to listen to Adv. Girish Raut, a well known environment activist during the event.

Originally as Nature Walkers India, AWARA walker-runner-volunteers cleared hundreds of tonnes of trash dumped on the river bed & carved a nature trail along that trained scores of middle & long distance runners, marathoners, some from slumkids & others from deprived backgrounds.  Such activity spurned away hordes of open defecators, waste dumpers, sand-miners, drug peddlars, vandals & other criminal elements off the river precinct.

From creating awareness of Global warming crisis, ending the use of plastic seed bags, preserving our natural resources and cultural heritage with the purpose of promoting tourism and environmental conservation as the leading sustainable community empowerment tool to uplift the socio economic status of the locals. Our organization does not only provide an opportunity for travelers to volunteer in Africa ’s most coveted destinations but also provides invaluable research opportunities for academia which include fellowship placements with sustainable-focused projects  across Africa , providing opportunities for hands-on learning and service. Our educational trips for students and young professionals make them learn about critical environmental issues and they contribute to create solutions across Africa. We welcome everyone to join and share their actions working together to increase examples of well-managed sustainable tourism and environmental conservation to uplift Africans out of poverty and instill them a sense of purpose and pride.
